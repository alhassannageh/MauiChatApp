As an AI language model, I don't have access to the source code of the Facebook Messenger app, and even if I did, it would not be ethical or legal to copy its code. However, I can give you a general idea of how some of the features in the Messenger app might be implemented.

Here are some key features that you might find in a Messenger app, along with a brief overview of how they could be implemented in code:

Chat thread - To display a chat thread in a Messenger app, you would typically use a FlatList or ScrollView component to render a list of messages. Each message would be represented by a custom component that includes the message content, timestamp, and sender information. You would also need to implement logic for sending and receiving messages over a network connection, possibly using a library like Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database.

Friends list - To display a list of friends in a Messenger app, you would typically use a FlatList or SectionList component to render a list of user profiles. Each profile would be represented by a custom component that includes the user's profile picture, name, and online status. You might also include functionality for searching and filtering the list of friends.

Notifications - To send push notifications to users in a Messenger app, you would need to integrate a third-party service like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS. You would also need to handle incoming notifications in your app code and update the UI accordingly.

Video calls - To implement video calls in a Messenger app, you would need to use a library like WebRTC to establish a peer-to-peer connection between users. You would also need to implement UI for displaying the video feed from the user's camera and from the remote user's camera, as well as controls for muting audio and video, ending the call, and switching cameras.

Group chats - To implement group chats in a Messenger app, you would need to extend the chat thread logic to support multiple participants. You would also need to implement functionality for adding and removing participants, changing the group name and image, and managing group settings.

These are just a few examples of the features you might find in a Messenger app, and there are many other details that would need to be taken into account when implementing each feature. The specific implementation details would also depend on the technology stack and design decisions chosen by the development team.
